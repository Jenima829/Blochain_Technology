🔗 Blockchain-based Academic Certificate Verification

📌 Project Overview  

This project is a simplified blockchain application that ensures the authenticity of student academic certificates.  
Instead of traditional paper-based certificates, each certificate is stored as a block in a blockchain.  
This makes it tamper-proof — if anyone tries to modify data, the chain breaks, and the fraud is detected.

------------------------------------------
⚡ Features:
#### 1.Secure Authentication
-Only authorized incharges can log in with username and password.
-If the password is entered wrong twice, the system flags suspicious activity and notifies the admin.
-Forgot password? → Enter the common secret code to reset access.

#### 2.Certificate Entry : Incharge selects Year, Section, Subject once → all student entries belong to that context.
-Each certificate stores: Student Name,Roll Number,Subject,Year & Section,Percentage Score
-A unique Certificate ID is generated (Subject initial + unique number).

#### 3.Blockchain Security : Hash of the block and Previous block hash
#### 4.Verification System : HRs, Universities, or anyone can enter a Certificate ID and instantly check if it exists in the blockchain.
